*Vending Machine Group Exercise*
​
Vending Machines give us the ability to buy food and drink anywhere we go! You are hired as a contractor to write a vending machine application for a new line of vending machines to be released.
​
The vending machine will have the following items and prices:
- Snickers  $1.25
- Popcorn   $1.00
- Chewing Gum $0.25
- Nuts $0.50
- Cookies $1.70
- Cup Noodles $2.25
​
The vending machine can accept the following currency:
- Nickel $0.05
- Dime $0.10
- Quarter $.25
- Dollar $1.00
​
When a person is buying from the vending machine, the following happen:
-- [DONE] A list of items is shown to them with the prices
--  [ DONE }They insert money into the machine based on the allowed currency above
-- They then select their item and the following can happen:
-- If the amount entered is less than what the item cost, an error message is produced stating they have not entered enough money
-- If the amount is equal to or above the amount of the item, they should get their item and left over change, if any
-- If they do not choose an item, all the money can be returned to them
​
Your task is to create a simulation in which 5 different buyers attempt to buy an item from the vending machine. Remember everything we have learned in class to use are your disposal:
- If Statements
- For Loops
- Arrays
- Objects
- Functions
​
1. You will be running this against 5 different people that enter different amounts and want different items. Your code MUST be re-usable.
​
2. The amount tendered should be stored. This is important because the amount tendered is going to:
     - Going to be compared against the cost of the item to determine if the item can be purchased
     - Going return the different between the amount tendered vs cost of the item
     -  Reset for each new person
​
3. Take everything ONE STEP AT A TIME.
​
With a partner, please discuss the problem by laying each piece of the problem 1 step at a time, and work your way through the problem.
